## Description ##

Conscience is an advanced theme for Awesome WM, which includes PNG
taskbar background and on-screen widgets. You can see how it looks on
the screenshot.png file.

Note that only a few layout icons are colored (because I use only
those layouts).

Conscience depends on the following projects:

* [awesome pre-3.5](http://git.naquadah.org/awesome.git)
